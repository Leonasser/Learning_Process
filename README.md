# Learning_Process
This repository is a collection of projects I have worked on with the objective of learning and practicing coding. Each branch in this repository, apart from the Main branch which holds this README, represents a different project.

# What You Will Find Here
In this repository, you will find a variety of projects that I have worked on. These projects cover different areas of programming and showcase various skills. Each project is stored in its own directory, complete with any necessary data files and a README file that explains the project in detail.

# For Recruiters and the General Public
If you’re a recruiter, feel free to browse through the code. Each project demonstrates my problem-solving skills, coding abilities, and understanding of programming concepts. If you’re a member of the general public interested in coding, you’re welcome to use these projects as a learning resource. Please bear in mind that this code is for reference and learning purposes and comes with no warranties or guarantees.

# Contributing
While this repository primarily serves as a personal code storage, contributions are welcome. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to make a pull request.
