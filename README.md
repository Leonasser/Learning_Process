# SoundScreen
This program is designed to fetch JSON files from online servers (for example, from GitHub) and display songs with specific properties such as Name, Artist, Duration, Genre, and Key note.

# Objective
The main objective of this project was to re-learn how to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). After a long break and learning C# at both basic and advanced levels for work, this project served as a refresher.

# Features
While the front-end may not be fully developed, the program successfully fetches and displays song data. It also has an implemented connection with ChatGPT. However, due to API credit limitations, this feature is currently not in use.


### Program made with the Alura C# Formation.
